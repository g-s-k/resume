\section*{Experience}
\subsection*{Visionist Incorporated}
\paragraph{}
\textit{Engineer 3} \hfill November 2020 --- present

\begin{itemize}
  \item Maintained and enhanced a group of analytics for audio data using
    Elixir as the API layer and Rust to implement the algorithms for its
    performance benefits. This was made relatively painless using the
    \textit{Rustler} library and the \textit{Phoenix} framework.
  \item Fleshed out a system management interface from a minimal scaffold into
    a useful tool using the \textit{Phoenix LiveView} library and
    \textit{Bulma} CSS framework. This interface is used to dynamically
    allocate and customize our analytic components via \textit{Helm}, and to
    monitor their performance, without needing to provide shell access to
    administrators or require them to understand \textit{Kubernetes}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
\textit{Engineer 2} \hfill August 2018 --- October 2020

\begin{itemize}
  \item Helped scale a suite of applications for real-time geographic data
    analysis up from prototype to production, focusing on performance and
    reliability. Improved communication between the development team and our
    user base to implement a faster and more robust feedback loop.
  \item Built and maintained a richly interactive web form using \textit{React}
    to give users fine-grained control over their analytic rules. Incorporated
    usability recommendations from our UX specialists, feature requests from
    our users, and technical requirements from our contract in each iteration
    of the design.
  \item Planned, contributed significant development time, and reviewed pull
    requests for our UI core library, a developer-organized effort to manage
    complexity in a suite of applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Nu-Tek Precision Optical Corporation}
\paragraph{}
\textit{Engineer 1} \hfill May 2016 --- August 2018
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed and maintained a proprietary MATLAB toolbox for processing a
    variety of optical data formats, supporting common manipulations such as
    Zernike decomposition, FFT analysis, and generation of corrective programs
    for computer-controlled polishing machines.
  \item Automated various administrative tasks such as printing work orders,
    tracking progress on each project, and generating customer documentation
    with \textit{PowerShell} and \LaTeX.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Research Foundation for the State University of New York}
\paragraph{}
\textit{Innovation and Partnerships Intern} \hfill Summer 2014 and 2015
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assisted in implementing the
    \href{https://esd.ny.gov/startup-ny-program}{START-UP New York} and
    \href{https://www.rfsuny.org/Our-Work/Innovation-and-Partnerships/Programs/Technology-Accelerator-Fund/}{Technology
    Accelerator Fund} programs.
  \item Performed a detailed analysis on the performance of hundreds of
    businesses associated with SUNY campuses to support a program proposal
    effort.
\end{itemize}

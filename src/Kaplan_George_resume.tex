\section*{Experience}
\subsection*{Elektron Music Machines}
\paragraph{}
\textit{Rust Audio Developer} \hfill May 2022 --- present
\begin{itemize}
  \item Building a development platform for the next generation of
    hardware music devices from Elektron, with a modern technical stack
    (\textit{Rust}, \textit{Protobuf}, \textit{RocksDB}) and primary
    design goals of portability and flexibility.
  \item Prototyping the initial products on the new platform, integrating
    both legacy IP and new concepts to create a unique and compelling user
    experience. Knowledge gathered in this process is then used to iterate
    on the design of the underlying infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Fearless Solutions}
\paragraph{}
\textit{Software Engineer 2} \hfill March 2021 --- April 2022
\begin{itemize}
  \item Adopted and expanded a prototype application built with \textit{React}
    and the \textit{Serverless Framework} into a production-ready state, and
    delivered it to users on time.
  \item Spearheaded an effort among technical personnel to improve code
    quality, test coverage, and user accessibility, leading to a significant
    decrease in defects and regressions pushed into the staging environment.
  \item Collaborated with security and operations teams to address findings
    from a pre-deployment audit. All findings were eliminated well in advance
    of the subsequent audit, and the deployment to production was able to
    proceed without incident.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Visionist Incorporated}
\paragraph{}
\textit{Engineer 3} \hfill August 2018 --- February 2021

\begin{itemize}
  \item Maintained and enhanced an audio processing and analytics service,
    with the API and administrative UI implemented using \textit{Phoenix (Elixir)}
    and the audio DSP implemented in \textit{Rust}.
  \item Scaled a suite of applications for real-time geographic data
    analysis up from prototype to production, focusing on performance and
    reliability. Improved communication between the development team and our
    user base to implement a faster and more robust feedback loop.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Nu-Tek Precision Optical Corporation}
\paragraph{}
\textit{Staff Engineer 1} \hfill May 2016 --- August 2018
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a 2D signal processing toolbox for MATLAB, for use in a specialized
    manufacturing environment. Supported a variety of ETL formats and domain-specific
    manipulations. Results could be visualized quickly, formatted with custom report
    templates using \LaTeX, or exported as program data for CNC correction processes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Education}
\subsection*{University of Maryland, College Park}
\paragraph{}
\textit{Bachelor's of Science in Physical Sciences} \hfill 2012 --- 2016

\begin{itemize}
  \item Concentrations in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, Chemistry, and Geology
\end{itemize}
